.Sh DESCRIPTION
pacmanlog2gource is a script (written in bash) to convert a copy of /var/log/pacman.log into a log file allowing later visualisation using the program 'gource'.
The script gets a copy of /var/log/pacman.log into ~/.pacmanlog2gource/ and converts this 'local' log afterwards (the original log isn't modified).
The converted log can be visualized using 'gource'.
There are two kind of logs: the tree-log shows packages in groups (ttf, python, library, xorg etc...).
The pie-log doesn't have the packages grouped.
This looks cluttered but packages that you installed earlier and didn't remove in between are shown in the middle of the screen which may be interesting to watch as well.
